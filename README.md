# ðŸ§ª Machine Learning Drug Classification  

This repository contains a **Machine Learning Drug Classification** project, which predicts drug types based on patient attributes. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  

- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of patient attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.  
- **Objective**: To classify the appropriate drug category based on patient characteristics.  
- **Models Used**: Various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
