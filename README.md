# 🧪 Machine Learning Drug Classification  

This repository contains a **Machine Learning Drug Classification** project, which predicts drug types based on patient attributes. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of patient attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.  
- **Objective**: To classify the appropriate drug category based on patient characteristics.  
- **Models Used**: Various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  

## 📂 Repository Structure  


## 🏗️ Implementation  

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.  
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  

2️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained multiple ML models and evaluated them using accuracy, precision, and recall.  
   - Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.  

3️⃣ **Deployment**  
   - Built a **Streamlit web app** for user-friendly drug classification.  
   - Deployed the model for real-time predictions.
